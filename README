Play framework event sourcing example.

The example application uses Play 2.5 and Eventuate(https://github.com/RBMHTechnology/eventuate) for event sourcing.

The events are written to a LevelDB log.

The application also implements a sample websocket to push all the trade messages to connected clients in json.
